# Serverless Project Naming Convention

## Overview

This document defines the naming convention for serverless projects in The Graphite Lab organization.

## Repository Naming Convention

### Format

```
serverless_<service-name>
```

Where `<service-name>` is:
- Derived from the `service` field in `serverless.yml`
- Converted to lowercase
- Hyphens preserved (already kebab-case)
- Version suffixes (v2, v3, etc.) included if present

### Examples

- Service: `toolbox-webhook-server-v2` → Repo: `serverless_toolbox-webhook-server-v2`
- Service: `user-authentication-service` → Repo: `serverless_user-authentication-service`
- Service: `api-gateway-proxy` → Repo: `serverless_api-gateway-proxy`
- Service: `data-processor` → Repo: `serverless_data-processor`

### Rules

1. **Always prefix with `serverless_`** - Identifies the deployment type
2. **Use kebab-case** - All lowercase with hyphens (no underscores except the prefix)
3. **Include version suffix** - If the service name includes v2, v3, etc., keep it
4. **Match serverless.yml** - Repo name should match the service name in serverless.yml
5. **Keep it descriptive** - Name should clearly indicate the service's purpose

## GitHub Organization

All serverless projects should be created under: **The-Graphite-Lab**

## Repository Structure

After creating the repository, ensure:

1. ✅ `.gitignore` includes Serverless Framework artifacts
2. ✅ `README.md` describes the project and deployment process
3. ✅ `serverless.yml` has correct service name matching repo name
4. ✅ `package.json` has appropriate name and description
5. ✅ Cursor rules are committed (`.cursor/rules/`)

## Migration Checklist

When creating a new serverless project repository:

- [ ] Create repository with naming convention: `serverless_<service-name>`
- [ ] Initialize git repository locally
- [ ] Add remote: `git remote add origin https://github.com/The-Graphite-Lab/serverless_<service-name>.git`
- [ ] Commit all files (excluding .gitignore patterns)
- [ ] Push to main branch
- [ ] Verify `serverless.yml` service name matches repo name pattern
- [ ] Update README.md with repository link
- [ ] Add any necessary GitHub Actions workflows
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules if needed
